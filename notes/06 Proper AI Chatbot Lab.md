# Proper AI Chatbot Lab

## Key Concepts (Understand)
- Combines local logic with cloud APIs to build production-style chatbots.
- Maintains conversation history and handles errors gracefully.
- Modular design separates prompt creation, model call, and response rendering.

## Deep Learning Technique (Absorb)
**Flow diagram:** Draw the message pipeline—from user input to model response—to solidify understanding of each component.

## Practical Application (Apply)
- Run the lab notebook and trace how messages are stored and reused.
- Add streaming response capability or logging to the chatbot.

## Reflection (Integrate)
- What components are essential for turning a demo chatbot into a deployable product?

## Memory Hooks (Remember)
- Think of the chatbot as a loop: input → process → output → memory update.
- Modularity is like Lego blocks—swap pieces without rebuilding everything.
