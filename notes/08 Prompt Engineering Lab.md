# Prompt Engineering Lab

## Key Concepts (Understand)
- Experimenting with prompts reveals how small wording changes affect results.
- Evaluation metrics or human review help compare prompt versions.
- Automation can scale prompt testing across many examples.

## Deep Learning Technique (Absorb)
**Active recall flashcards:** Create Q&A pairs about prompt failures and fixes to reinforce best practices.

## Practical Application (Apply)
- Run the lab to iterate on prompts for a chosen task and log results.
- Write a script that batch-tests multiple prompts against sample inputs.

## Reflection (Integrate)
- How can I systematize prompt evaluation in real projects?

## Connections (Expand)
- [[07 Prompt Engineering]]
- [[09 Retrieval-Augmented Generation]]
- External: [PromptBench](https://github.com/microsoft/promptbench)

## Memory Hooks (Remember)
- Treat each prompt like a hypothesisâ€”test and refine.
- Think A/B testing but for text instructions.
