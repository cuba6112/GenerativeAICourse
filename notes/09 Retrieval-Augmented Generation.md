# Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Key Concepts (Understand)
- Combines external knowledge retrieval with generative models for grounded answers.
- Uses embeddings and vector databases to find relevant documents.
- Retrieved context is inserted into prompts to reduce hallucinations.

## Deep Learning Technique (Absorb)
**Mind map:** Draw the RAG flow: query → embed → search → retrieved docs → prompt → generation.

## Practical Application (Apply)
- Build a simple RAG pipeline using a vector store like FAISS or Chroma.
- Evaluate answer quality with and without retrieved context.

## Reflection (Integrate)
- What data sources would enhance accuracy for my domain-specific application?

## Memory Hooks (Remember)
- Think of RAG as an open-book exam for LLMs.
- Embeddings are search fingerprints for your documents.
