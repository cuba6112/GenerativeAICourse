# AI Applications in Production

## Key Concepts (Understand)
- Deployment requires scalability, monitoring, and cost management.
- User feedback loops and A/B testing improve models post-launch.
- Security and compliance guard against misuse and data leaks.

## Deep Learning Technique (Absorb)
**Mind map:** Chart the lifecycle—from prototype → deployment → monitoring → iteration—to reinforce production flow.

## Practical Application (Apply)
- Outline a deployment plan including logging and rollback strategies.
- Design a user-feedback mechanism that captures prompt/response ratings.

## Reflection (Integrate)
- Which production risk—cost, latency, or safety—is most critical for my use case?

## Memory Hooks (Remember)
- Production AI is a marathon, not a sprint; continuous monitoring is key.
- Think "build, ship, watch" as the cycle of deploying models.
