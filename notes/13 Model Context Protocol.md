# Model Context Protocol

## Key Concepts (Understand)
- MCP standardizes how models access tools and context from external sources.
- Defines schemas for requests, responses, and tool descriptions.
- Encourages interoperability between different agent frameworks and services.

## Deep Learning Technique (Absorb)
**Analogy:** Think of MCP as the "USB protocol" for connecting models to accessories.

## Practical Application (Apply)
- Review an MCP schema and identify required fields for a simple tool.
- Design a hypothetical service that exposes data to agents via MCP.

## Reflection (Integrate)
- How could a common protocol reduce vendor lock-in for AI applications?

## Memory Hooks (Remember)
- MCP unifies communication just like HTTP unifies web requests.
- Picture plugging a new gadget into an agentâ€™s port and it "just works."
