# Agents

## Key Concepts (Understand)
- Agents are autonomous systems that plan, act, and optionally use tools.
- Components often include planning, memory, tool interfaces, and feedback loops.
- Safety considerations are crucial as agents can take actions without supervision.

## Deep Learning Technique (Absorb)
**Flow diagram:** Outline an agent loop—observe → plan → act → learn—to visualize autonomy.

## Practical Application (Apply)
- Design a pseudo-agent that selects between web search and calculator tools.
- Define guardrails or permissions for each tool.

## Reflection (Integrate)
- What responsibilities come with deploying agents that can act on my behalf?

## Memory Hooks (Remember)
- Think of agents as "LLMs with arms" able to take actions.
- The loop O→P→A→L (Observe, Plan, Act, Learn).
