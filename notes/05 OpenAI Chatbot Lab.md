# OpenAI Chatbot Lab

## Key Concepts (Understand)
- Hosted APIs like OpenAI provide state-of-the-art models with minimal setup.
- Usage is metered by tokens, requiring budgeting and monitoring.
- System prompts steer personality and behavior of the chatbot.

## Deep Learning Technique (Absorb)
**Analogies:** Compare API calls to mailing letters—your prompt is the letter, the response is the reply you receive.

## Practical Application (Apply)
- Use the OpenAI API to send a message and display the response.
- Experiment with different system prompts to change the assistant's style.

## Reflection (Integrate)
- When would a cloud API outweigh the benefits of running a local model?
