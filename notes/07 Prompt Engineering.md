# Prompt Engineering

## Key Concepts (Understand)
- Clear instructions, context, and examples improve model outputs.
- Techniques include zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting.
- Iterative refinement and evaluation lead to more reliable responses.

## Deep Learning Technique (Absorb)
**Feynman technique:** Explain to a novice why adding examples can transform model performance.

## Practical Application (Apply)
- Draft a prompt, note the response, then refine it with context and examples.
- Create a mini guideline checklist for writing effective prompts.

## Reflection (Integrate)
- When should I rely on prompt engineering versus altering model parameters or training data?

## Memory Hooks (Remember)
- Prompting is "programming in plain language."
- Use the mnemonic CLEAR: Context, Language, Examples, Audience, Result.
