# MCP Lab

## Key Concepts (Understand)
- Implements a service following the Model Context Protocol.
- Demonstrates registering tools/endpoints and handling requests from an agent.
- Highlights debugging and validation steps for protocol compliance.

## Deep Learning Technique (Absorb)
**Flow diagram:** Map request flow: agent → MCP server → tool → response → agent.

## Practical Application (Apply)
- Run the lab to expose a simple data source via MCP and query it with an agent.
- Add an additional endpoint and update the schema accordingly.

## Reflection (Integrate)
- What challenges arise when multiple agents access the same MCP service?

## Memory Hooks (Remember)
- MCP server is the "socket"; tools are the plugs.
- Validation is your safety check before plugging in.
