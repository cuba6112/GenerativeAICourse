# Introduction to AI

## Key Concepts (Understand)
- AI shifts computers from explicit instructions to learning from data.
- An AI model is a mathematical function whose parameters are learned from examples.
- Three main learning paradigms: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
- Modern AI surged due to the convergence of algorithms, data, and compute.

## Deep Learning Technique (Absorb)
**Feynman technique:** Teach a friend how predicting house prices from size changes when using AI instead of a fixed formula.

## Practical Application (Apply)
- Create two examples of tasks and classify whether they require supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning.
- Write a short script that uses a simple linear model to predict house prices.

## Reflection (Integrate)
- Where in my daily workflow could I replace manual rules with learning from data?

## Memory Hooks (Remember)
- Think of AI as teaching by examples instead of instructions.
- Remember the "A+C+D" stool: Algorithms + Compute + Data.
- Visualize a dog training session for reinforcement learning.
