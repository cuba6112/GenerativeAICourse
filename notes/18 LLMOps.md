- Automation (CI/CD) ensures reliable updates and rollback capabilities.

## Deep Learning Technique (Absorb)
**Feynman technique:** Explain to a colleague how LLMOps differs from traditional DevOps.

## Practical Application (Apply)
- Set up logging for prompts, responses, and costs in a sample app.
- Create a rollback plan for switching between model versions.

## Reflection (Integrate)
- What metrics best capture "quality" for an LLM in production?
