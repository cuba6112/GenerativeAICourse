# RAG Lab

## Key Concepts (Understand)
- Hands-on construction of a retrieval and generation pipeline.
- Importance of chunking documents and choosing the right embedding model.
- Evaluation requires checking both retrieval relevance and answer accuracy.

## Deep Learning Technique (Absorb)
**Analogies:** Think of the retriever as a skilled librarian who fetches books before the writer composes an answer.

## Practical Application (Apply)
- Run the lab to index a small document set and answer questions over it.
- Experiment with different chunk sizes or embedding models to see effect on retrieval.

## Reflection (Integrate)
- How does retrieval quality influence user trust in generated answers?

## Connections (Expand)
- [[09 Retrieval-Augmented Generation]]
- [[11 Agents]]
- External: [Chroma Documentation](https://docs.trychroma.com/)

## Memory Hooks (Remember)
- Retrieval first, generation secondâ€”like research before writing.
- Good chunks are like book chapters: coherent and self-contained.
