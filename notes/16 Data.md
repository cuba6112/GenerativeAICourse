# Data

## Key Concepts (Understand)
- Data sourcing, cleaning, and labeling determine model performance.
- Privacy, security, and licensing must be considered when using datasets.
- Synthetic data and augmentation can expand limited datasets.

## Deep Learning Technique (Absorb)
**Analogies:** View data as fuel—quality and purity affect engine performance.

## Practical Application (Apply)
- Create a data checklist covering collection, consent, and storage.
- Augment a small dataset using simple transformations or synthetic examples.

## Reflection (Integrate)
- How do I ensure ethical use of data in my AI projects?

## Connections (Expand)

## Memory Hooks (Remember)
- Garbage in, garbage out—data quality drives results.
- Data governance is the seatbelt for AI development.
