# Agents Lab

## Key Concepts (Understand)
- Implements an agent that can choose and invoke tools based on user goals.
- Emphasizes state management: remembering past actions and results.
- Demonstrates safeguards like tool whitelists or user confirmations.

## Deep Learning Technique (Absorb)
**Active recall flashcards:** Test yourself on the sequence of steps the agent takes to complete a task.

## Practical Application (Apply)
- Run the notebook to let an agent interact with at least two tools.
- Extend the agent with a new tool and define constraints for its usage.

## Reflection (Integrate)
- How can I audit an agentâ€™s decisions after it completes a multi-step task?

## Memory Hooks (Remember)
- Picture a robot choosing tools from a belt as it works.
- Agents need both a map (plan) and a memory of where they've been.
